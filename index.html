            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am 20 years old, currently studying at <strong><a href="https://www.capsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capiz State University Dayao Satellite College Campus</a></strong>
                as a Second Year BSCS student. I want to be a great innovator, but I feel that most people reject or dislike those who don’t code manually. I’m not saying I don’t code manually, 
                but the problems keep getting harder, and they aren’t even taught in school. So instead, 
                <span class="read-more-btn">See More...</span>
                <span class="extra-content">
                    relying on other resources shouldn’t be shameful—that’s why I embrace open platforms 
                    where I can gain more ideas. To be straight to the point, I am an LLM enthusiast. I love experimenting with Large Language Models' capabilities. Most people don’t fully grasp 
                    their potential; they only see the threats and benefits. Artificial Intelligence is the future. However, I don’t know if AI developers have a contingency plan for potential risks. 
                    But since they are part of big tech, I trust that they don’t neglect security and safety measures.
                    I’ve talked too much! What I’m trying to say is that I prefer fast progress rather than slowing myself down. 
                    I don’t want to wait for lectures because I’m sure that, at a deeper level, they don’t explicitly teach the proper application of 
                    concepts in real-world problems. Identification, classification, and quizzes can only help to a certain extent, but they don’t truly 
                    contribute to the growth of computer science. Instead, they often lower one’s self-esteem, leading to impostor syndrome.
                    That’s all I have to say. As long as I stay dedicated and love what I do, I will always be confident in myself, embrace 
                    failure, and never neglect my studies as long as I live.
